## Occupation Trends 2001 - 2021
# Summary
To analyze job trends from 2001-2021, looking to see the impacts that three major events in our country had on those occupations over that period of time. 

# Motivation
Upon joining Nashville Software School, I had just taken a hard pivot in my career after ten years, coming out of the field of performance. The decision to leave the theatre industry was supported by the instability that already existed in the field, and was only exacerbated in the wake of COVID-19.  This stark career shift left me wondering about people who, like me, chose to change their career and what motivated them to do so? Did the COVID-19 era leave people across all occupations questioning their career path? This lead me to think about two other challenging times in our country's recent history - The Recession from 2007-2009, as well as the aftermath of 9/11. After pulling in National data to observe the trends, I decided to take a deeper dive by pulling in individual states' data, to provide a clearer visual in the form of a map to see the rise and fall of occupations over the years, by state. 

# Data Questions
Can you see noticeable changes in occupation trends during and after three major challenging times starting in 2001?

# Data Sources
Data was used directly from The Department of Labor Statistics' Occupational Employment and Wage Statisics (https://www.bls.gov/oes/), and used over 40 tables of data. 

# Known Issues and Challenges
As years progressed, new jobs arose, categories shifted, and occupation titles and codes changed. The most drastic shift was in 2012 where many occupations added multiple branches, which doubled some of the data. Using both Python and Tableau, I was able to weed through many of these inconsistencies.
